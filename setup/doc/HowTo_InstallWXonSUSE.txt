Manual installation procedure for wxWidgets 2.8.7 in SUSE

head for:

http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

Current Stable Release: wxWidgets 2.8.7 Download

grab  Source Archives item  -  wxGTK 

you will get:  wxGTK-2.8.7.tar.gz
choose rightclick - extract to here 

open a shell
go for the extracted directory (you will find 24 files and some folders 
including readme-gtk.txt etc.)

From that file I took:

----Snipp----

If you compile wxWidgets on Linux for the first time and don't like to read
install instructions just do (in the base dir):

> mkdir buildgtk
> cd buildgtk
> ../configure --with-gtk --disable-unicode
> make
> su <type root password>
> make install
> ldconfig
[if you get "ldconfig: command not found", try using "/sbin/ldconfig"]

If you want to remove wxWidgets on Unix you can do this:

> su <type root password>
> make uninstall
> ldconfig

----Snipp----

../configure takes quite a while to run
make does even longer (as long as it is compiling don't worry)

The ../configure mail fail because you do not have a development environment installed.
So it can complain about a missing c++ compiler or missing libraries of any kind incl. gtk2

Go for YAST and grab the c++ development suite (about 250MB download)

Run the ../configure  --with-gtk --disable-unicode  procedure again.

or if you are experienced get a decent c++ compiler, then development libs for:
 gtk2, libtiff, libpng, libjpg, expat - then again run the procedure.

if all went well you may install the wxAstroCapture rpm package using YAST again
