HowTo setup the code::blocks (CB) and Bazaar (Bzr) tools:
20070422/BM

1) Install code::blocks from a nightly build  but NOT the old RC1
  Win:
    download and add mingwm10.dll into the CB install directory
    download and add wxmsw26u_gcc_cb.dll into the CB install directory

2) Get Bazaar and install it
  Win: The PATH environment variable addition may take effect only after reboot
  UX: use Adept and look for Bazaar

3) Create a project main directory  e.g.  wxWebcamDB
   
4) Open a shell (UX)  or cmd (Win) and cd to that directory

5) Run Bazaar for the first time - type into the shell
   $>   bzr whoami  "username <mail@address>"   e.g. "bm <bm@doodle.com>"
   check it by using 
   $>   bzr whoami
   should respond the typed name

   --> this should also create your personal Bazaar config files here:

Win: C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\bm\Anwendungsdaten\bazaar\2.0  (in english it's ..\username\Application Data\
UX:  ~/.bazaar   (~/ is the home dir and .something is a hidden dir use ls -a to find it)

6)  Init the Project workspace and pull the project
   $>   bzr init

   then use    bzr pull LOCATION   (where LOCATION is ftp://ftpuser@ftpserver/  provide a password when asked for it)
   $>   bzr pull ftp://wxWebcamDB%40burri-web.org@burri-web.org    
	
   --> now the project directory should be populated with the latest project files

7) Run CB for the first time  - just double click it
  
   --> this should also create your personal CB config files here:

Win: C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\bm\Anwendungsdaten\codeblocks  (in english it's ..\username\Application Data\
UX:  ~/.codeblocks   (~/ is the home dir and .something is a hidden dir use ls -a to find it)


  --> Exit CB !!!


8) Find the file CBtools_W32.conf  and CBtools_UX.conf in the bzr_scripts directory 


9) Find the file  "default.conf"  in the CB user settings directory  see Pt.8 
   now open this one and merge the content of the file CBtools_W32.conf  (CBtools_UX.conf) into the two sections 
	<tools>  and   <gcv>   make sure not breaking the structure !!
      change the path names in the <gcv> section  (global variables)

   --> this should add the Bzr and some more tools and global vars used in the project


10) Find the file default.bzr_script.cmd  and default.bzr_script.sh in the bzr_scripts directory 
    copy them without the default.  part and and change the preferred VIEWER ONLY
UX:  change the permission of bzr_script.sh  to Executable  (in Properties - second tab)	

11) Open CB and there the project  e.g. "wxWebcamDB.cbp"  

   --> Verify Menu   Settings-Global Variables
   --> Verify Menu   Tools 

   --> Run e.g. Tools - Bzr INFO    (your VIEWER program should pop up and display the Bazaar project info)
