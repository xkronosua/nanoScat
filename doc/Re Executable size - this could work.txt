Betreff: Re: Executable size - this could work

Here are some notes for optimizing executable size

I edited /etc/environment file and added
CXXFLAGS="-O2 -Os"
(this was because ../configure --help mentions use of CXXFLAGS)

NOTE TO SELF: /etc/environment defines PATH also

I recompiled wxWidgets static library
=====
mkdir buildgtkd
cd buildgtk
../configure --with-gtk --with-gtk --disable-shared --enable-unicode 
make 
sudo make install <password> 
sudo ldconfig 
=========

(add also "--enable-debug" for debug version)

Code::Blocks
=========
Global variable 'wx'  /usr ==> /usr/local Build options UX_release: enable option -Os (Optimize generated code size) Rebuild all

This generates an executable with size=4.6 MB !!
then
upx-nrv wxAstroCapture

and the resulting executable is ......
[DRUMS PLAYING HERE]
..... 1.4MB !!!

I think this is usable for static libs :-)

This should make distribution to other distribution MUCH easier I think!

---


To make the release build work properly I built wxWidgets in this order 0. build from buildgtk subdir 1. config/make/install Debug version 2. Delete all files in buildgtk subdir 3. config/make/install release version

This made the release version the default one, and debug the "alternate match". Since release is not explicitely mentioned in wx-config when building release version, it seems to be a requirement........?

Code::Blocks: the 'wx' global variable must be /usr/local
Code::Blocks: the -Os compiler option must be enabled for UX_Release

Finally I added a post build step for UX_Release target (in build options) upx-nrv UX/bin/Release/wxAstroCapture

The post-build step compresses the executable from 4.6 to 1.4MB. The post build step obviously means that the package 'upx-nrv' must be installed in Adept when building wxAstroCapture. As far as I understand it, the resulting compressed wxAstroCapture is an in-place, self-extracting binary which can be used exactly as the uncompressed one.

The question is: Does this eliminate ALL external dependencies for wxAstroCapture  .deb file? It should eliminate wxWidgets, GTK+ and C/C++ runtimes I think? If so, it should run on essentially all Linux platforms without any install hassle?
